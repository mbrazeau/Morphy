## How do I cite Morphy?
There currently isn't a citable object for Morphy. Some of the speed-improving optimisations are still experimental and undergoing extensive testing. So, I am not sure I recommend using it for publication yet, but you are welcome to if you would like. For now, please cite [Brazeau, M.D., Guillerme, T. and Smith, M.R. 2019. An algorithm for Morphological Phylogenetic Analysis with Inapplicable Data. Systematic Biology](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/68/4/619/5238046) when referring to the algorith and point readers to this page for the software.
