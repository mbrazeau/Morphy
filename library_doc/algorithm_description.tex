\section{First downpass} \label{1stDp}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Enter on any of the tips of the tree and focus on its closest ancestor (hereafter referred as the ``focal node'') then go to \ref{1stDp:ANDdescen}.
    \item \label{1stDp:ANDdescen} \textbf{If} there is a state in common between both descendants of the focal node, \textbf{set} the focal node state to the states in common \textbf{then} go to \ref{1stDp:ANDinap}. \textbf{Else} go to \ref{1stDp:ORdescen}.
    \item \label{1stDp:ANDinap} \textbf{If} the state of the focal node is now only the inapplicable token but that both descendants also have at least one applicable state, \textbf{set} the focal node state to be the union of both descendants states; \textbf{then} go to \ref{1stDp:exitLoop}.
    \item \label{1stDp:ORdescen} \textbf{If} there is a no state in common between both descendants, \textbf{set} the focal node state to be the union of both descendants states; \textbf{then} go to \ref{1stDp:ORinap}.
    \item \label{1stDp:ORinap} \textbf{If} both descendants have also applicable states, \textbf{remove} the inapplicable token from the the focal node state; \textbf{then} go to \ref{1stDp:exitLoop}.
    \item \label{1stDp:exitLoop} Go to the closest ancestor from the focal node and repeat from \ref{1stDp:ANDdescen} until all the nodes in the tree have been visited.
\end{enumerate}

\section{First uppass} \label{1stUp}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Enter the tree on the root. \textbf{If} if the root has both inapplicable \textit{and} applicable states, \textbf{remove} the inapplicable state; then go to \ref{1stUp:firstNode}.
    \item \label{1stUp:firstNode} Select the next focal node after the root; then go to \ref{1stUp:entryLoop}. 
    \item \label{1stUp:entryLoop} \textbf{If} that focal node as an inapplicable token go to \ref{1stUp:NodeInapplicable}; \textbf{else} go to \ref{1stUp:NodeApplicable}.
    \item \label{1stUp:NodeInapplicable} \textbf{If} the focal node also has any applicable state \textit{and} \textbf{if} the state of the focal node's ancestor has an inapplicable token, \textbf{set} the focal node state to be the inapplicable token; \textbf{then} go to \ref{1stUp:repeat}. \textbf{Else} go to \ref{1stUp:ancAppli1}.
    \item \label{1stUp:ancAppli1} \textbf{Remove} the inapplicable token from the focal node states; \textbf{then} go to \ref{1stUp:repeat}.
    \item \label{1stUp:NodeApplicable} \textbf{If} the focal node's ancestor state has an inapplicable token, \textbf{set} the focal node state to be the inapplicable token \textbf{then} go to \ref{1stUp:repeat}. \textbf{Else} go to \ref{1stUp:ancAppli2}.
    \item \label{1stUp:ancAppli2} \textbf{If} the union between the descendants is applicable \textbf{set} the nodal state to be this union \textit{and} \textbf{remove} any eventual inapplicable tokens; \textbf{then} go to \ref{1stUp:repeat}. \textbf{Else} go to \ref{1stUp:ancAppli2}.
    \item \label{1stUp:ancAppli3} \textbf{Set} the focal node state to be the inapplicable token only; \textbf{then} go to \ref{1stUp:repeat}.
    \item \label{1stUp:repeat} Select to the next node and repeat from \ref{1stUp:entryLoop} until all nodes have been visited; then go to \ref{2ndDp:exitLoop}.
    \item \label{1stUp:exitLoop} Exit the first uppass.

\section{Second downpass} \label{2ndDp}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Enter on any of the tips of the tree and focus on its closest ancestor then go to \ref{2ndDp:entry}.
    \item \label{2ndDp:entry} \textbf{If} the focal node state has an applicable state, go to \ref{2ndDp:Appli}. \textbf{Else} go to \ref{2ndDp:Inapp}.
    \item \label{2ndDp:Appli} \textbf{If} the the focal node's two descendants have both in common at least on state that is not the inapplicable token, \textbf{set} the focal node state to be this common state (without any inapplicable token); \textbf{then} go to \ref{2ndDp:repeat}.
    \item \label{2ndDp:Inapp} \textbf{Else} the \textbf{set} the focal node's state to be the union between both descendants without any eventual inapplicable token; \textbf{then} go to \ref{2ndDp:repeat}.
    \item \label{2ndDp:repeat} \textbf{Else} leave the the focal node's state unchanged and repeat from \ref{2ndDp:entry} until all nodes have been visited; \textbf{then} go to \ref{2ndDp:exitLoop}.
