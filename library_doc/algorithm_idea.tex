\begin{enumerate}

\item Proceed inapplicable Fitch down-pass.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If intersection between two descendants and has an inapplicable solve potential applicable interaction but keep inapplicable.
        % If union of applicable
            % set to union
        % else set to combination

        % If inapplicable in any
            % add inapplicable
        % done
    \end{itemize}

\item Update dummy root.

\item Proceed to up-pass with following conditions. If current node has an inapplicable:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If both descendants and ancestor have at least one inapplicable, solve to inapplicable only.
        \item If both descendants have a least one inapplicable, don't resolve the ambiguity and add an inapplicable token.
        % If node is inapplicable
            % temp = union between both descendants
            % if temp are inapplicable AND one of them is strictly inapplicable
                % if ancestor is inapplicable
                    % set to inapplicable
                % else 
                    % solve applicables + set inapplicable
            % else 
                % combine applicables
            % done
        % else 
            %combine applicables
    \end{itemize}

\item On the third pass (second down-pass). If current node has inapplicable:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the immediate ancestor is an inapplicable, solve to inapplicable OR if both descendants have an inapplicable solve to inapplicable.
    \end{itemize}

\item Done.
