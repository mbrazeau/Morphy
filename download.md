## Install

On most systems, running the program shouldn't require any special installation. Mac users may need to follow the instructions below.

### Mac:
To install on macOS you will need to use the Terminal and navigate to the directory where the Morphy executable is stored and enter the command:

	sudo chmod a+x <morphy executable name>
	
To run Morphy, simply issue the command:

	./<morphy executable name>
	
Macs are quite restrictive about permissions for programs downloaded from the web. So, when you first try to run Morphy, the  operating system will try to stop you. Navigate to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy` and choose "Allow" for Morphy.
